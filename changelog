Bug reports and support: @notkernel

As some of you already know I broke my mido and I have been wearing raphael now. So as I dont have the device this will be 
the last PUBLIC RELEASE for mido. You can always flash CI builds from my group and if you are a developer my sources are open

Thank you for the support all these years :)
